Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve Fros experience without being explicitly programned. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning: Learning with labeled data

2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data

3. Reinforcement Learning: Learning through rewards and penalties

Applications include image recognition, speech processing, and recommendation systems
